CIBMTR - Equity in post-HCT Survival Predictions

<h1>Kaggle Competition: Equity in Post-HCT Survival Predictions</h1>

<p>The goal of this competition is to improve the prediction of post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) survival rates equitably for different patient groups.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> To predict survival rates of patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplants, considering equity among different demographic groups.</li>
    <li><strong>Data:</strong> The dataset contains information about patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplants (HCT).</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation Metrics:</strong> Uses the Kaplan-Meier method for survival analysis and the concordance index (C-index) to assess predictive performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Competition Overview</h2>
<p>The objective of this competition is to develop models that improve survival rate predictions for patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). The crucial point here is to ensure that each patient has a fair chance of a successful outcome, regardless of their background.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Improving survival predictions for patients with allogeneic HCT is an essential health challenge, as current predictive models often fail to address disparities related to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Socioeconomic status</li>
    <li>Race</li>
    <li>Geography</li>
</ul>
<p>Addressing these gaps is fundamental for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Improving patient care</li>
    <li>Optimizing resource utilization</li>
    <li>Rebuilding trust in the healthcare system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Competition Objectives</h2>
<p>The competition aims to encourage participants to advance predictive modeling, ensuring that survival predictions are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Accurate</li>
    <li>Fair for patients from diverse groups.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Synthetic Data</h2>
<p>Participants will use synthetic data that mirrors real-world scenarios while protecting patient privacy. This allows for the construction and improvement of models that more effectively consider diverse backgrounds and conditions.</p>

<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>You are challenged to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Develop advanced predictive models for allogeneic HCT that enhance accuracy and fairness in survival predictions.</li>
    <li>Tackle disparities by integrating diverse data sources, refining algorithms, and reducing biases.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>Your work will help to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a more equitable and effective healthcare environment</li>
    <li>Ensure that every patient receives the care they deserve</li>
</ul>
